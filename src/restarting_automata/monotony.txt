definition:
let have RRWW automaton [] A then A is monotonous iff for all acceptable words there are not 2 successive cycles with rewrite where the position of rewrite from the right sentinel is greater then in the previous cycle.

Proof from jancar99:
In the paper he used set of words created from alphabet V of sufficient length such that all instructions would be used at least once. 
That has large downfall for anyone who would like to program such proof as algorithm, because of the exponential growth of possible words up to acceptable length. 


My attempts on the algorithm:
1.
From definition of automaton I can easily get the places where rewrite ocure.
So let spit the problem to 2 scenarios, 2 successive rewrites not overlapping and 2 that overlaps.


Let such states define as "RS", then for each RS i can get to what word it is rewritten let it denote as "w".
If we split w = 'uv' where |u| > 0 and |v| > 0, then we just need to find all rewrites that starts with 'v'.
That is wrong, because it could have ended (as rewrite or in accept state) before it even reach this rewrite point.   

For that there is easy fix let just find if there exists some rewrite that ends with 'u'. 
The 'u' and 'v' are not set so we have to find all that ends with prefix of w.
This can get huge too but it should work except it does not.
The problem is same as the last iteration, ... 

So let view the problem from different angle from graphs perspective.
Let has directed graph such that has start in starting state with all states that has left sentinel.
And lets add edges for each state that has instruction move right for each symbol in alphabets if there exist such state with given state. 
And repeat for each new vertex created, if there has to be created already created vertex just add the edge to the already created.
With this all states should be present in graph at most only once, the unaccessible states are not included.
Each edge corresponds to one symbol so if there is vertex with rewrite then if we go backwards by edges and then forward by edges that corresponds to rewrite we should end up in states (there can be more than one edge with same symbol to one vertex) from where there is path to any rewrite iff the automaton is monotonous.

2. digraph algorithm 
For creation of digraph I use simple algorithm that iter through all instructions and take all possible states that are included in definition of automata.
Let call them `possible states`, then I iter again and try to find next state from each state but i will discard all that are not included in the `possible states`.
With this i create dictionary with keys as `possible states` and values next states from those and the edge needed.

Bit problem is there with the `*` symbol that needs to have separated cases.

With created digraph we can follow with the algorithm for monotonicity of automata

The data are stored in simple dictionary, that can be transcribed to dot format () which can be easily visualized.   

3.
Let collect all states in which there is rewrite as `rewrite states`.
Lets give the vertexes in digraph values depending on how far are they from rewrite.
So for rewrites it is 0 and for others it is by default -1.
For each vertex that has 0 lets go backwards to change all vertexes values to 1 if their value is -1.
Lets repeat this with BFS algorithm (or DFS not yet implemented) and always increase value by one.
When there is no more vertex that has rewrite as successor we go for next step.
for each vertex with value 0 we trace back by the edges that corresponds to the rewritten window.
then follow the edges forward by the rewrite, from definition we know that rewrites can be only rewritten to smaller word.
If there is any state (there can be multiple forks on the road back and forward, and some can have death end) with positive value then the automaton is not monotonous.


4. proof (kind of...)
Let have automaton A with definition ... , then there exists only one representation of given automaton as digraph with vertexes as combination of states and possible windows.
with edges as symbols that are used in transition from one state+window to another, the symbol is there only for MVR instruction for others instructions the symbol is empty.
# why there is only one such digraph?
then the digraph corresponds to ... and from the digraph there can be created words that are accepted by automaton A with endings in Accepting state. 
# wrong wording I do not know how it is called in literature and what exactly are the properties of such graph.
lets discard all vertexes that are not ending in Restart or Accept state.

if we trace the rewritten window back and forward we get state that is accessible from the initial state and the distance from the left sentinel is still lower then the rewrite.
then if there is rewrite further then difference between length of difference rewrite and rewritten window then the automaton can rewrite further from the left sentinel then the last rewrite,
 as such the automaton is not monotonous.
If there does not exist such case then the automaton is monotonous.

Why it allways go to the rewrite location?

# digraph algorithm 11.7.2022

digraph with star in middle is problematic becouse it is not always possible to determine what is in window, it could happen that the star can represent only few windows.
The windows that it could represent can be get from the edges that are connected to the star.
But if multiple star are in the graph then it is exponential.
So this is resolved separatedly after the graph is created.
Example of such automaton: window is of length 3, and the autamotan only accepts words with "a" on odd positions and odd length.
Then the graph is created as follows:
s0 #a. -> s1 MVR
s1 * -> s0 MVR
s0 a.a -> s1 MVR 
s1 .a$ -> Accept 
s0 #a$ -> Accept

I will take last configuration and if it is not star then i will try to make 2 MVR instructions.
If it is star then I will reculsively select last configuration.

another example is 
same --//--
s0 #bb -> s2 MVR
s2 bbb -> s0 MVR
s0 bbb -> s2 MVR
s2 bb$ -> Accept

the digraph should not have any edge between s0 with "bbb" and star. 

state = s0
window = "bbb"
configuration = s0[#bb] (state[window])

In the end i have gone with simple replacement of star with any configuration while adding the configuration into possible configurations of the automaton.
But this force me to add one more cycle through the instructions to correctly connect the new configurations to the other configurations by edge.
This is needed to be done after the first cycle is finished. 
Becouse all of the possible configurations of the automaton are not known before the first cycle.

so with this I can finaly test monotonicity of the automaton.

let start with the simple case that rewrites are far away with non deterministic automaton.
example of this can be correct pairs of brackets. with additional instruction for MVR if the brackets are paired.

initial_state: q0
alphabet: (, )
working_alphabet: 
size_of_window: 2
name: brackets
type: RLWW
doc_string: This automaton 
q0 #$ -> Accept
q0 () -> qr []
q0 () -> q0 MVR
q0 (( -> q0 MVR
q0 )( -> q0 MVR
q0 )) -> q0 MVR
q0 #( -> q0 MVR
qr * -> Restart

the digraph algorithm is broken again, this time with rewrites...
there are now 2 edges to qr with in the graph of brackets...
