# 1. Introduction

- implement software tool for experiments with restarting automata
- should be able to straightforward design, simulate, store and test given automata
- should have constrains for different types of restarting automata which will not allow some instructions
- the emphasis is put on easy to use and extendability of new types of restarting automata
- check determinism, ... of given automata
- check if automata is monotonic
- presenting automata on web with simulation / which allow users to test automata with theirs own words

# 2. Related work / all "math"

- what was done
- related work with automata
- usage on reduction analysis of natural languages
- what is automaton
- rrww ....

# 3. Analysis

- why i choose Python from all languages
- why i choose json
- why i choose this text format
- why I used django and not flask
- how i get here / what I tried and fail and what succeed
- what libraries and algorithms was chosen and why alternatives and pros and cons

# 4. Specifications

- similar to introduction but detailed

# 5. Development / Design

- how it all works together

## Technology

- django
- python3
- json

## Data format

- text
- json

## structure

- what is in library
- specific methods from library and theirs
- how is the project structured / web and library + library methods
- tests?

## methods

- what is monotonous automaton /left right
- constrains -> RRWW RRW ...
- speed of algorithm
- correctness of methods

# 6. User documentation

- how to install
- how to use
- tutorials / scenarios

# 7. Programmer documentation

- format of protocols that communicate with server/web client
- how to expand types
- how to expand tests

# 8. conclusion
